Greetings Ms.Rajabi,

Here is your interview task report:

* nice design,
* nice utility folder structure,
* nice axios config
* nice tailwind setup
* nice form flow

you may need to:

* use absolute paths
* use app dir patterns (page.tsx, route.tsx, layout.tsx, error.tsx and etc)
* use more secure auth patterns (httpOnly cookies, middlewares , next built-in api routes and etc)
* use more modern fetching technologies like swr/react-query/redux-toolkit query
* use state manager


overally, well done!

Regards,
Ali Rabiee
